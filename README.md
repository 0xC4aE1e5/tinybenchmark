# tinybenchmark

`tinybenchmark` is a tiny benchmarking tool. It's based on dialog boxes, so it has a simple and easy to use GUI. The higher the score, the better. It's also written in PowerShell, and to build it, you need `ps2exe` from PSGallery, and `make` from Scoop. Once you have the dependencies, just run `make`.
